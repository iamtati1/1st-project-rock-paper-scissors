# Additional Features:

- Cool Hand Gesture! (For computer and player)
- Audio for each gesture ()
# File Structure

- **index.js**       (Entry point of the app)
- **menu.js**        (Displays menu and handles user choices)
- **game.js**       (Contains game logic and data)
- **package.json**   (stores the Node.js dependencies, along with node_modules-[ansi-regex, prompt-sync, sound-play, strip-ansi]).
- **README.md**      (Project documentation)
- **REFLECTION.md**  (a written reflection of my game)

# Technical Concepts

**Objects**: Store player stats like wins, losses, and ties.

**Higher-order functions**: Methods like .forEach() or .filter() help process arrays.

**Modules**: Uses require() and module.exports to connect files.

**Ternary operators**: Simplify if/else statements for cleaner code.

# Reflection

This project helped me understand how JavaScript logic, objects, and conditionals work together to create an interactive gaming experience.
I also practiced modular design(seperating my project into smaller workable pieces) and learned how to structure files like a real software developer.

I feel more confident handling more projects in the future, and I'm excited to learn more!
