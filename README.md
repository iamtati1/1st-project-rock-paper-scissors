“Best Of” mode to compete across multiple rounds

Input validation and retry messages

Organized menu navigation and user feedback messages

Uses modular file structure (index.js, menu.js, game.js)

📁 File Structure
.
├── index.js         # Entry point of the app
├── menu.js          # Displays menu and handles user choices
├── game.js          # Contains game logic and data
├── package.json     # Node.js dependencies
└── README.md        # Project documentation

💡 Technical Concepts

Objects: Store player stats like wins, losses, and ties.

Higher-order functions: Methods like .forEach() or .filter() help process arrays.

Modules: Uses require() and module.exports to connect files.

Ternary operators: Simplify if/else statements for cleaner code.

🧠 Reflection

This project helped me understand how JavaScript logic, objects, and conditionals work together to create an interactive experience.
I also practiced modular design and learned how to structure files like a real-world developer.
